# skeleton

This is a skeleton repo for learning git

This will help people understand how git operates

It will be a tool for all ages.

Files can be in 4 states, untracked, unstaged, staged, committed.

Commits remain local on your local chain until they are pushed to a remote repo.

Branches allow changes to happen simultaneously without affecting eachother in a way that the merge of branches can be managed efficiently.
